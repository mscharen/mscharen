- 👋 Hi, I’m @mscharen or Michael James Scharen, new science-fiction author and webmaster for michaelsbookcorner.com.

I do have a B.S./M.A. in physics and thought I could actually learn to code.
I started as a computer science major but abaondoned it to study physics instead.
Computer science is too hard!

- 👀 I’m interested in making my e-commerce site more efficient, faster loading, more secure, mobile friendly, easier to maintain -- the whole works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. Javascript, CSS, .htaccess, cache, CDNs, HTML, security, compression...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing thus far as I am mainly looking for resources to learn this stuff for my website so I can sell digital books.
Collaboration later when I actually have some skills might be an option.
- 📫 How to reach me : E-mail me via authorScharen@physicist.net or throuth Twitter @michael_scharen
